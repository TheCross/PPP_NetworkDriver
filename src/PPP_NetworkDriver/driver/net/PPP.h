 * @date        2017.09.25
 * @author      M. Strosche
 * @brief       Header file of the PPP-Protocol-Stack.
 *              This module implements the PPP-Protocol-Stack for the
 *              Data-Link-Layer of the OSI-Model. It receives data from a serial
 *              connection and parses it byte-by-byte. Valid payload-data will
 *              be transfered to a higher level by executing a
 *              callback-function. The frame-format of the PPP-packets is HDLC.
 *
 * @since       V0.0.3, 2017.09.25:
 *                      -# Added net_PPP_setMtuSize. (MS)
 *                      -# No typedefs for struct and enum. (MS)
 *                      -# Added net_PPP_getState. (MS)
 *                      -# Moved enum net_PPP_state_e from c to h. (MS)
 *
 * @since       V0.0.2, 2017.09.12:
 *                      -# Modified doxygen-comments. (MS)
 *
 * @since       V0.0.1, 2017.09.11:
 *                      -# Initial version. (MS)
